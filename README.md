## Installation Instructions <a name="installation"></a><br>
 To install this app you would need to place the index.js in whatever desired directory where you would like the README.md to be generated. Run npm install (or npm i) to install all of the dependencies. Once these are completed you have only to type node index.js to run the app.
## Usage Guidelines <a name="usage"></a>
 This app was created as a bootcamp class project to make README.md files for our GitHub repositories. I think it works great for that. One addition I may make in the future would be in inclusion of a screenshot.
